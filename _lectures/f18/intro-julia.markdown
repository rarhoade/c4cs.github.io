# What is Julia?

  - High performance dynamically typed language
  - WAY faster than python (almost as fast as C)

# Why Julia?

  - Lots of easy to use libraries
  - It's basically executable math

```julia
julia> area(r) = Ï€ * r^2
area (generic function with 1 method)

julia> area(3)
28.274333882308138
```

# Moving to the Cloud

--

## Why?

  - Don't have to have your computer on 24/7
  - MORE POWER

--

## Which Service?

  - AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure should all work fine
    - All should give you free credits to start too!
  - Azure has a [data science image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro) with everything we need already installed
