title:  Fixing Ambiguous Grade Ranges

The grade ranges as originally published had ambiguous endpoints
(e.g. 18-20&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A- and 20-24&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A, so what is a 20 worth?).
I have fixed these such that all ambiguities favor the higher grade
(e.g. 18-19&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A- and 20-24&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A), as was
my original intent.

Apologies for any confusion.
