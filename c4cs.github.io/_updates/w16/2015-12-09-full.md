#### _First, please add yourself to the waitlist if you are still interested in this class._

A large waitlist could help justify a larger classroom (if we can get one) or
possibly additional sections (though I will say upfront this will take a little
more doing and is less likely). With apologies to those who will not be able to
enroll this term, as this is first time this course will be offered I&rsquo;m
not sure I can handle something too enormous.

While I appreciate the enthusiasm for this course, **please don't e-mail me if
you&rsquo;re on the waitlist to ask if you will be able to register**.
I will post any and all information about additional enrollment availability
here as soon as I know.

Thank you all for the support and enthusiasm.
