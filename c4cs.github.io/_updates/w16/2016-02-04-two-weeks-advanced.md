Advanced homeworks will now have a two week window for submission.
This change first affects advanced homework 4, whose deadline is now
extended until before lecture on the 12th. This means at any given
time, two advanced homeworks will be &ldquo;in flight&rdquo;, one on
its first week and one on its second week.  The pdf for advanced
homework 4 has been updated to reflect this change.
