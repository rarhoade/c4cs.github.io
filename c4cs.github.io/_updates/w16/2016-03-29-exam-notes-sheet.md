Because several people have asked, we will also allow a typed notesheet.

If you choose a typed notesheet, you may use margins no smaller than 1" on all
sides, line spacing no smaller than single spaced, and either Times New Roman
or [OpenDyslexic](http://opendyslexic.org/) font no smaller than 12.

We will be collecting notesheets (typed or handwritten) after the exam.
