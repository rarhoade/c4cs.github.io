title:  Two Additional Sections

We opened two additional sections today. Unfortunately, due the way
that special topics classes are handled by the registration backend,
there was no way to transfer the wait list to the new sections (this
is a unique problem for special topics classes, and they aren't usually
this popular...). To give the waitlisted students the best chance, we
e-mailed only waitlisted students to alert them of the new sections and
asked people to keep it quiet. It was the best we could do with an
unfortunate situation.

As of 8&nbsp;PM, both new sections are full. It looks like about 80% of the
original waitlist was able to register. My sincerest apologies to those on the
original waitlist who missed the window.  At this point, we do not expect to
open any more additional sections.

Finally, I would like to extend an extra-special thank you to
<a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/etc/fac/EECSfaculty.html?uniqname=mmdarden">Marcus Darden</a>,
who agreed to teach an overload semester so we could add another
section and allow more students to take the course.

Looking forward to seeing you all next term. Best of luck on exams!
