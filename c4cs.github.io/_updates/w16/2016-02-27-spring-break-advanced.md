title:  Advanced Homework Make-up Over Break

A student made a great suggestion that break week could be a good opportunity
for some folks to catch up on advanced homeworks. With that thought in mind, we
will allow you to do one previous advanced homework and turn it in the week
after spring break. You can't choose Advanced Homework 5, since we covered that
in the optional lecture this week.

You will need to stop by OH to submit this any time during the week of
3/6-3/12, note this includes Friday afternoon office hours, which are normally
too late. I highly recommend that some people take advantage of
Monday/Tuesday's OH and avoid the rush at the end of the week.

If I were deciding among the advanced homeworks, I would probably rank them
4 > 6 > 2 > 3 > 1.
