A few people have asked for better feedback on grades and progress through the
class. There is not a great way to do this on Gradescope, so I will be keeping
cTools up to date with grades.

The cTools grades for attendance and homework grades should be straightforward.
For the advanced homework assignments, cTools doesn't have a great way of
representing a "choose 3 of 12" system.  I have added two categories, _Advanced
Homework_ and _Advanced Homework Raw_.  Notice that the _raw_ category has a 0%
weight (it will not count in your final score). It is simply a placeholder for
you to verify that your advanced homework has been counted. I will add final
scores for advanced homeworks at the end of the semester.
