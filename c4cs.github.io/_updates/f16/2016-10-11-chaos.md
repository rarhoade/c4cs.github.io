title:  Extension for Advanced Homework 4, OH Cancelled 10/12, Alex Lecturing

Due to some unexpected personal events, Pat will not be in Ann Arbor on Friday,
and needs to cancel the Friday 12-1:30 Office Hours. Alex will be teaching
lecture on Friday afternoon.

Because we've shuffled office hours a lot this week, and because early next
week is fall break, we're going to extend the deadline for Advanced Exercise 4
one week. Both Advanced Exercise 4 and Advanced Exercise 5 are now due on
October 22nd.
