# In lectures, we collected a list of commands and concepts people have seen.
# This is the aggregate list across all three lectures. It includes things
# we've explicitly covered in class (git, sed, echo, wc, ...) and things
# people have encountered (whoami, fortune, cowsay, ...). In a few weeks,
# we'll use this as the basis for a project, but I wanted to share the list in
# case it's useful for anyone now.
